# SwInDel
A basic editing tool for swapping, inserting and deleting sections of a protein sequence.  Works for other sequences as well. 
To run, two initial .csv files are required.  The first file is input.csv.  This file contains the protein name (e.g. GFP) and the sequence.  The second file "Mutations.csv" is a list of any mutations (Swaps, Insertions or Deletions) to be done.
